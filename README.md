## Abstract
Intrusion can compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a computer system. Intrusion Detection System(IDS) is a type of security software designed to monitor network traffic and identify network intrusions. In this paper, A Fuzzy Ruleâ€“Based classification system is used to detect intrusion in a computer network. In order to improve the classification rate, a new method is proposed based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for rule weights specification. The proposed method is tested on the KDD99 dataset. Experimental results show the proposed method improves the performance of the fuzzy rule-based classification systems in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate.
